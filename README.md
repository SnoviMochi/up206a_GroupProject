Group Project
# I will be working on this project by myself. The data that I will be attempting to extract from will be encounters of law enforcement with youth
# The idea is to understand where the largest need for youth diversion programs can be placed within Los Angeles County.
The hope and desire of this project is to determine where there should be increased contracting between LA County and with Community Based to meet the needs of the community
I'd hope to also check out ongoing neighborhood disparities, which would require data about school budgets (lower budget schools and their relation to their neighborhood and crime rate), high school graduation rates, demographics of neighborhoods - all overlapped with crime rates in different areas of los angeles.
