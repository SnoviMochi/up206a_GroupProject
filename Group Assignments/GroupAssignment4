##Re-imagining Youth Justice: Analyzing Youth Arrest data to identify highest Need##

#Status update: 
#Overall, I am feeling a bit stressed because of trying to catch up with all the homework. 
#However I feel really excited because I feel like having the open source of the Mayor's office for arrest data is very very helpful!

#Data update :
#I had looked at data that was focused on libraries, just to give contect or atleast a hubs for resource centers for youth diversion. However I was seeing that the data was overall pretty confusing. I also accessed some data that had to do with schools, and the data is a lot cleaner it's just a huge data set which I am having trouble putting together.

#Concerns:
#Not knowing really how to code. I've been having a lot of trouble 'uploading' data and having the notebook recognize it and so I've been trying to find data that is easier to use. 
#Looking online and asking the online forms for information is daunting because everyones research is so different and it feels like I am having trouble differentiating how the code can help.
#Also trying to do census data and make it look nice has been challenging.
