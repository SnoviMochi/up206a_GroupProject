##Re-imagining Youth Justice: Analyzing Youth Arrest data to identify highest Need##

**Status update**: 
Overall, I am feeling a bit stressed because of trying to catch up with all the homework. 
However I feel really excited because I feel like having the open source of the Mayor's office for arrest data is very very helpful!

**Data update**: 
I had looked at data that was focused on libraries, just to give contect or atleast a hubs for resource centers for youth diversion. However I was seeing that the data was overall pretty confusing. I also accessed some data that had to do with schools, and the data is a lot cleaner it's just a huge data set which I am having trouble putting together.

**Concerns**: 
Not knowing really how to code. I've been having a lot of trouble 'uploading' data and having the notebook recognize it and so I've been trying to find data that is easier to use. 
Looking online and asking the online forms for information is daunting because everyones research is so different and it feels like I am having trouble differentiating how the code can help.
Also trying to do census data and make it look nice has been challenging.
